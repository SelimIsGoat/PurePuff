        <h1>Hello, We are PurePuff</h1>
        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
           We all came together with this idea together in Las Vegas. We were all together in a casino in Vegas when all of a sudden a guy smoking fell to the ground. Later that day, we found out he had passed away due to a smoking related lung condition. After that, wasted no time in creating PurePuff. PurePuff is a diffuser that is used once someone is already addicted to smoking/vaping, and it stops the addiction by having the similar 100% natural scent/smell, such as fruit scenets. After all dedicating time to this project, we got sponsors and became a worldwide product.
